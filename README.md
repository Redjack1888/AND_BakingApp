# Baking App
![Cover](/assets/smartmockups_k7q0anbo.jpg)

The task is to create an Android Baking App that will allow Udacity’s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. You will create an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

The recipe listing is located [here][1].

The JSON file contains the recipes' instructions, ingredients, videos and images that will need to complete this project. Don’t assume that all steps of the recipe have a video. Some may have a video, an image, or no visual media at all.

One of the skills to demonstrate in this project is how to handle unexpected input in your data -- professional developers often cannot expect polished JSON data when building an app.

## Project Overview
[Rubric][2]

You will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

### Why this project?

As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide, it will be up to you to figure things out for the Baking App.

### What will I Learn

In this project you will:
- Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
- Handle error cases in Android.
- Add a widget to my app experience.
- Leverage a third-party library in the app.
- Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
